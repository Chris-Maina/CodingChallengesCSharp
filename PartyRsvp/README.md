## Party RSVP
### Challenge
Write a C# function that combines two lists, checks for duplicates, and checks the combined list against a third list for overlapping items.

**Input**
- No input

**Output**
- Total invites, duplicates, and missing RSVP guests

Example:
If you have 3 lists
Family = {"Harrison", "Joe", "Grace"}
Friends = {"Jake", "Mary", "Joe"}
RSVP = {"Jake", "Grace"}

Output will be
Six total invites
One duplicate -> Joe
Missing RSVPs -> Harrison, Mary, Joe
